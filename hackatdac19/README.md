# HACK@DAC 2019
This directory contains the design from the [HACK@DAC 2019 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac19) snapshotted at commit 57e7b2109c1ea2451914878df2e6ca740c2dcf34.

The properties.md table contains the properties we wrote for 10 of the 66 known bugs in the design, along with their associated bug descriptions and CWE-ID. The bug numbers and bug descriptions come from the [HACK@DAC 2019 site](https://hackthesilicon.com/dac19-setup/) (scroll to the bottom). In some cases, existing CWE entries pointed to one of these 10 known bugs, and we use that CWE-ID. Otherwise, we matched CWEs to bugs using our understanding of the bug and our reading of the CWE descirptions.
