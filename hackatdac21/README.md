# HACK@DAC 2021
This directory contains the design from the [HACK@DAC 2021 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21) snapshotted at commit bcae7aba7f9daee8ad2cfd47b997ac7ad6611034.

In the property table, you will find 29 properties we wrote for 29 of the known bugs in the design, along with their CWEs and associated bug descriptions. The bug descriptions were written by the competition organizers and we matched the CWEs to each bug using some prior work and our reading of the CWE descriptions. 

The properties.md table contains the properties we wrote for 29 of the 99 known bugs in the design, along with their associated bug descriptions and CWE-ID. The bug numbers and bug descriptions come from the [HACK@DAC 2021 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21). In some cases, existing CWE entries pointed to one of these 29 known bugs, and we use that CWE-ID. Otherwise, we matched CWEs to bugs using our understanding of the bug and our reading of the CWE descirptions.
