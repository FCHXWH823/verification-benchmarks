# HACK@DAC 2021
This directory contains the design from the [HACK@DAC 2021 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21) snapshotted at commit bcae7aba7f9daee8ad2cfd47b997ac7ad6611034.

The properties.md table contains the properties we wrote for 29 of the 99 known bugs in the design, along with their associated bug descriptions and CWE-ID. The bug numbers and bug descriptions come from the [HACK@DAC 2021 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac21). In some cases, existing CWE entries pointed to one of these 29 known bugs, and we use that CWE-ID. Otherwise, we matched CWEs to bugs using our understanding of the bug and our reading of the CWE descriptions.
