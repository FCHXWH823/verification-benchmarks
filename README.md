# Hardware Security Verification Benchmarks
This repository contains security properties for the formal verification of open-source processors and SoCs. In the directory corresponding to each design is a set of properties written as SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA). Each property is documented with a description of the bug it finds and is tagged with the related CWE(s). The README in each directory describes the snapshot of the design found in that folder, including the particular commit of the design and any bugs that have been inserted.

We encourage the community to contribute new properties and pull requests are welcome!
