# Hardware Security Verification Benchmarks
This reposititory contains security properties for the formal verification of open-source processors and SoCs. In the directory corresponding to each design is a set of properties written as SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA). Each property is documented with a description of the bug it finds and is tagged with the related CWE(s). The README in each directory describes the snapshot of the design found in that folder, including the particular commit of the design included and any bugs that have been inserted.

We encourage the community to contribute new properties and pull requests are welcome!

These properties are first described in [_anonymized submission_]. As part of that submission, we describe a literature review of papers related to formal properties in hardware security verification. The papers included in that literature review are listed here.
