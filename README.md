# Hardware Security Verification Benchmarks
This reposititory contains benchmarks for performing formal verification of open-source processors and SoCs. In the directory corresponding to each design, you will find a README describing the snapshot of the design found in that folder, including the particular commit of the design included and any bugs that have been inserted. Additionally, each verification benchmark includes a set of security properties, written in SystemVerilog. These properties are also documented and tagged with associated CWEs they are aiming to capture. 

We encourage the community to contribute and pull requests are welcome!
