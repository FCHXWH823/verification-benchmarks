# HACK@DAC 2018
This directory contains the design from the HACK@DAC 2018 repo snapshotted at commit X. The url to the repo we cloned the design from is here: YY.

In the property table, you will find 19 properties we wrote for 19 of the known bugs in the design, along with their CWEs and associated bug descriptions. The bug descriptions were written by the competition organizers and we matched the CWEs to each bug using some prior work and our reading of the CWE descriptions.
