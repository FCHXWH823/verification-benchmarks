# HACK@DAC 2018
This directory contains the design from the [HACK@DAC 2018 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac18) snapshotted at commit 60534635d40f397d71b45be511d954af2c0c7b3d. 

The properties.md table contains the properties we wrote for 20 of the 31 known bugs in the design, along with their associated bug descriptions and CWE-ID. The bug numbers and bug descriptions come from the [HACK@DAC 2018 repo](https://github.com/HACK-EVENT/hackatdac18). In some cases, existing CWE entries pointed to one of these 19 known bugs, and we use that CWE-ID. Otherwise, we matched CWEs to bugs using our understanding of the bug and our reading of the CWE descriptions.
